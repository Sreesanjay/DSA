# Tree 
A tree data structure is a hierarchical structure that is used to represent and organize data in a way that is easy to navigate and search. It is a collection of nodes that are connected by edges and has a hierarchical relationship between the nodes.  
### Basic tree terminologies  
- Node  
Node represents an element or data point within the tree. Each node contains data and zero or more links (often called "child" links or references) to other nodes.  
- Root  
In a tree data structure, the "root" is the topmost node in the hierarchy, and it serves as the starting point for navigating the tree.   
- Parent and Child  
A "parent" node is a node in a tree that has one or more child nodes directly connected to it.  
A "child" node is a node in a tree that is directly connected to a parent node.
Child nodes are at a lower level in the hierarchy than their parent node.  
- Leaf  
In a tree data structure, a "leaf" (or "leaf node") is a node that has no child nodes  
- Sibling  
In a tree data structure, "siblings" are nodes that share the same parent node. Sibling nodes are at the same level in the hierarchy and have the same immediate ancestor.  
- Depth 
In a tree data structure, "depth" refers to the level or distance of a node from the root node. It is a measure of how deep a particular node is in the tree hierarchy.  
- Height  
The height of a node refers to the length of the longest path from that node to a leaf node in the tree. Height of the tree is the height of the root node.
