# Data Structure & Algorithms
Data Structure is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
## Why to learn about data structure and algorithms?
As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.

   - Data search - As data grows, search will become slower.

   - Processor speed - Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.

   - Multiple requests - As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.
   
DSA is used to solve above problems. Data can be organized in a data structure in such a way that all items may not be required to be searched, and the required data can be searched almost instantly.

   

## Classification of Data Structure

### 1. Linear Data Structure
- Data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.

   eg. array, stack, queue, linked list, etc.
     #### 1. Static data structure
     Static data structure has a fixed memory size. It is easier to access the elements in a static data structure. 
     <br>
     eg. Array

     #### 2. Dynamic data structure
     In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed. It can be randomly updated during the runtime which may be considered efficient concerning the memory (space) complexity of the code.

      eg. Quee, Stack etc.
### 2. Non-linear data structure
- Non-linear data structures are those where data items are not arranged in a sequential manner, unlike linear data structures. In these data structures, elements are stored in a hierarchical or a network-based structure that does not follow a sequential order. These data structures allow efficient searching, insertion, and deletion of elements from the structure.

  eg. tree, graph, etc.
