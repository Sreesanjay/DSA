<h1>Data Structure & Algorithms</h1>
Data Structure is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently. It is also used for processing, retrieving, and storing data.
<h3>Why to learn about data structure and algorithms?</h3>
As applications are getting complex and data rich, there are three common problems that applications face now-a-days.
<ul>
    <li>Data search</li> 
    As data grows, search will become slower.
    <li>Processor speed </li> 
    Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.
    <li>Multiple requests</li>
    As thousands of users can search data simultaneously on a web server, even the fast server fails while searching the data.
</ul>
