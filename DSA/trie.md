# Trie Data Structure 
Tree is a tree like data structure. It is also known as prefix tree. It is used for storing and searching a specific key from a set. The search complexity can be brought to optimal limit (key length).
If we store keys in a binary search tree, a well balanced BST will need time proportional to M * log N, where M is the maximum string length and N is the number of keys in the tree. Using Trie, the key can be searched in O(M) time. `   `
