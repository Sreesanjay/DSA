# Memory Management

The term memory can be defined as a collection of data in a specific format. It is used to store instructions and process data.
Memory management is the process of controlling and coordinating a computer's main memory. It ensures that blocks of memory space are properly managed and allocated so the operating system (OS), applications and other running processes have the memory they need to carry out their operations.
