# Complexity analysis

Complexity analysis is defined as a technique to characterise the time taken by an algorithm with respect to input size (independent from the machine, language and compiler). It is used for evaluating the variations of execution time on different algorithms.

What is the need for Complexity Analysis?

  - Complexity Analysis determines the amount of time and space resources required to execute it.
  - It is used for comparing different algorithms on different input sizes.
  - Complexity helps to determine the difficulty of a problem.
  - often measured by how much time and space (memory) it takes to solve a particular problem

The efficiency of an algorithm depends on two parameters:

  - Time Complexity
  - Space Complexity
  
Time Complexity: It is defined as the number of times a particular instruction set is executed rather than the total time taken. It is because the total time taken also depends on some external factors like the compiler used, the processorâ€™s speed, etc.

Space Complexity: It is the total memory space required by the program for its execution.
